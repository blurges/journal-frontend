Progressive Web App, available offline.

To-do:
Tests.
Scroll to top on page load.
Add password preview.
Darken login icons.
Add password preview button.
On edit cancel reset note state. And fix the jumpy button.
Colour buttons that need attention: save when unsaved (new, edited), confirm delete.
Add loading indicator: syncing - ok - offline - resync on click.
First load and first call require waking up a dyno each. Cloudfront? Netlify?
